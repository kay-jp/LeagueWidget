# LeagueWidget Project

## Overview
This is a fresh import from GitHub repository: https://github.com/kay-jp/LeagueWidget

## Current State
The repository is currently empty, containing only:
- `.gitattributes` - Git configuration for line ending normalization
- `.replit` - Replit configuration file

## Status
**October 23, 2025**: Project imported from GitHub but contains no source code yet. The repository appears to be newly initialized with only an initial commit.

## Next Steps
To begin development, you'll need to:
1. Decide on the technology stack (e.g., React, Vue, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for a League of Legends widget)
2. Initialize the project with the necessary files and dependencies
3. Set up the development workflow

## Notes
- Waiting for code to be added to the repository or instructions on how to proceed with development.
